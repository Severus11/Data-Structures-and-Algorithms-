## Biinary Heaps
### Heaps are complete binary trees, satisfying one of these conditions:
- 1. Max Heap-  where the descendents of the parent are lesser than or equal to it.
- 2. Min Heap- The descendents are greater than or equal to the parent.

- Heaps are generally represented using arrays
- Height is always logn
- not used for searching purpose
- Only the root of the heap can be deleted. Hence, the largest in max heap and smallest in the min heap.
- priority queue can be implement using max or min heap depending upon the priority set by the user.
