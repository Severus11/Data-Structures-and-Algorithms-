# Data Structures and Algorithms
These are a collection of inception and intiution to popular data structures coded in C++ language. These codes depict my, a  non-coder's journey from arrays to lists to stacks, queues and so on. Hence, they are all portrayed with proper intuition to each data structure, their inception and their STL i.e. shorter and more functional versions.

Though I was comfortale with python and java, I chose to start these with C++. Here is why you should too !

### Why should you learn DSA in C++ first?
- Start with C++, youâ€™ll have a grip on the basics of every other programming language.
- C/C++ are often termed as the mother of programming languages, DSA in them gives better intuition to each concept and algorithm.
- While implementation in python could be shorter in length and easier to program, C/C++ give you a better insight in structure of programming, hence one can easily visualize what exactly is being programmed.

### Which IDEs could you use ?
C/C++ languages compile using GCC/ G++ compilers, various versions of which are available online. The following IDEs are popularly used to program in C/C++:
- Code Blocks
- Turbo C++
- DEV C & DEV C++
- Visual Studio Code
- CLion (1 month free trail)
